I was getting asked by a lot of people if they could help out in some way - I genuinely get so happy whenever I see people enjoying these HD mods; checking out Twitch always puts a huge smile on my face and makes my day.  I'm looking at buying a new PC desk and some extra SSD storage, as my current one is causing me back pains and my disk space is dwindling~ You're not enforced or encouraged to do so in any way, but I've set up a donation link here:

A Final Fantasy XI HD Project for models - Armor, Enemies, NPCs, Magic effects etc.  This project currently is not looking at upscaling Zones (IE: Towns, Dungeons, etc - Although Ru'Aun Gardens has been completed as a test for how this would work), and instead of focused on sharpening up and upscaling textures of all other NPC/player based objects.

I'm working on items from a release perspective (Original > Jirat > CoP > ToAU, etc) - I'm currently not playing FFXI, however I have played FFXI on retail for nearly 2 decades since original JP release on PC.  It is my favourite video game of all time, and I hope I can accurately keep it's aesthetics as close to the original as possible.
